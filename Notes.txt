-Comparable provides one method named compareTo() but Comparator provides one method named compare().
-Comparable provides only one sort of sequence but Comparator provides multiple sorts of sequences.
-Comparable provides natural sorting order and comparator can provide customize order.

Q.Advantage of inheritance?

Dear sir,
I hope this email finds you well.
I am writing to inform you that I have completed the task that you had given to us to copy records from one table to another.

If you have any questions or further information please let me know.
Thank you for your time.

Best Regards,

Project workflow-
------------------

The DSA360 Project streamlines the management of Direct Selling Agents (DSAs) by integrating multiple core modules.
The system begins with DSA Management, where agents are onboarded, assigned territories, and their profiles are maintained.
The Customer Management module handles customer records, interactions, and relationships, while the Lead Management module helps capture and assign leads to DSAs.
The Sales Management module records transactions, generates invoices, and processes payments, which directly impacts the Commission Management module that calculates and tracks DSA earnings. 
Performance Tracking monitors sales targets and KPIs, while Reporting & Analytics generates insights into sales, customer behavior, and DSA performance. 
The system ensures secure access through Authentication & Authorization and enhances communication with Notifications & Alerts. Additionally, the Integration Module syncs with external systems like CRMs and payment gateways. 
Document Management organizes important files, and Task Management helps DSAs stay organized with reminders. Finally, the Loan & Tax Toolkit provides financial calculators for accurate pricing and commission calculations. 
All these modules work together to optimize DSA operations, enhance sales efficiency, and improve customer relationships.

===================================================


"My project is focused on the DSA (Direct Selling Agent) Registration Process for banks and NBFCs. 
It involves automating and streamlining the registration process for individuals or entities who want to 
become DSAs.

The project covers the complete registration workflow, starting from submitting an application to 
a bank or NBFC, making necessary payments, and furnishing required documents. The system ensures document 
verification, due diligence by the legal team, and credit history checks. Once the verification process is 
complete, the system generates a DSA registration agreement, which applicants need to sign and submit. 
After approval, a DSA code is issued, allowing the agent to start submitting loan applications and documents.


The project ensures efficiency, reduces manual paperwork, and enhances transparency in the registration process. 
It also integrates compliance checks like CIBIL score validation and legal verification, making it a robust 
and scalable solution for financial institutions."



The @Entity annotation specifies that this class is an entity and should be mapped to a database table. 
The @Table annotation specifies the name of the database table that will store instances of this entity.
The @Id annotation specifies the primary key of the entity,
the @GeneratedValue annotation specifies that the primary key should be generated automatically.
